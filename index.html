    <div class="About_me">
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm a physics student in "Sapienza Università di Roma".<br>
        I am interested in many different topics, mostly I have been concerned with the study of systems composed of many - often interacting - components.
        <br>The 2 areas on which I have focused my Master studies are condesed matter and statistical mechanics.<br>
      </ul>
    I am also particoularly interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics and in general in the history and philosophy of science.<br>
    My other big passions, outside of physics, are drawing and anything sea related (swimming, freediving, scuba diving, surfing...).

  <p>
    You can get a rough idea of what I'm like from this list of heroes of mine: Pierre Gilles de Gennes, Enrico Fermi, Marie Curie, Alan Turing, Quentin Blake, Kim Jung Gi, Paul Klee. 
  
    <br><br>And from this list of my favourite books: The lord of the rings, The sirens of titan, IT, Maus, Enigma: la strana vita di Alan Turing.

    Here are some links I found while surfing the web:<ul>
    <li>A beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwYhg0K8GSo" target="_blank">video</a> on the life and science of Pierre Gilles de Gennes.</li>
    <li>The extremely famous article <a href="https://www.tkm.kit.edu/downloads/TKM1_2011_more_is_different_PWA.pdf" target="_blank">"More is different"</a> by Philip W. Anderson.</li>
    <li>Another <a href="https://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/howiwork.html" target="_blank">article</a>, this one not written by a physicist but instead by the (Nobel prize winning) economist Paul Krugman. It is not hard to draw analogies between his domain and the hard sciences, and he offers refreshingly grounded views on the relationship between mathematics (models) and reality.</li>
    <li>A wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoYimmmFptg" target="_blank">video</a> (in italian) on the science of complexity featuring Giorgio Parisi.</li>
